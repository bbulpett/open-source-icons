# open-source-icons
Some icons I made as badges for open source software and components.

#### Reason
I found the need for some icons to illustrate things that were used to make projects. They are small in size because they're merely meant to complement similar "Font-Awesome" style icons. So I spent some time making these icons. They're white .png images on transparent backgrounds.

##### If you find these offensive or problematic, send me a message. 
In other words, don't sue me. I've put this on GitHub free to share with the world.
